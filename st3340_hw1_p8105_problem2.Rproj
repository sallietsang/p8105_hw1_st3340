# Problem 2

The following code chunk loads the dataset

```{r import data}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

```{r a view on the data}
#summary of the dataset penguins
summary(penguins)
head(penguins)
#number of row AND Col
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
#calculate the mean flipper_length_mm and exlude all the missing value
mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE)

```
There are 8 variables,ranging from species, island, bill length and depth in mm , flipper length in mm, body mass in g, sex and age.
The dataset includes 344 rows and 8 cols.
There are a total of 344 penguins, which can be divided into three species(152, 68, 124 belongs to Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo respectively),
the population of penguins in island Biscoe, Dream and Gentoo are 168, 124 and 52 respectively. 
The mean of the bill length and depth are 43.92 and 17.15mm respectively,
whereas thier average flipper length is 200.9mm with a mean of 4202g body mass.
Some data are missing within this dataset, the calculation are done by assuming the na.rm = TRUE 

##Making a scatterplot 
```{r plotting a scatterplot of penguins}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species )) + geom_point()
```

```{r export_plot}
ggsave("penguins_scatterplot.pdf")
```
